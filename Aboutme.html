         <strong>In Short:</strong>
         <br>
         <br>
          I'm a UX designer with a background in product design and kitchen and interior design.
         <br>
         <br>
         I have a naughty Tonkinese cat, called Whittaker <i>(please hire me because he deamnds new toys and lots of treats! = expensive).</i>
        <br>
        <br>
         I love to travel, learn about new cultures and languages, and if I'm not working I'm probably designing something or making something on my 3D printer.
         <br>
         <br>
         <br>
         <br>
         <br>
         <strong>In Long:</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        As a teenager I was intrigued by the idea of inventing a product and being able to make a business out of it.
        From a young age I loved making things, anything, from building a garden from scratch with my mum, making things in woodworking and metalwork class at school, soldering LED circuit boards to light up my illustrations, to sewing clothes for my dolls <i>(and my cat).</i><br>
        I was pretty thrilled when I found out that product design was an actual job you could get paid to do. So with that thought, I enrolled in a Bachelor of Design - majoring in Product Design at Auckland University of Technology.
        <br>
        <br>
        I loved every minute of it! <i>(well, almost every minute, the assessment deadlines and presentations were pretty intimidating).</i><br>
        Graduating in 2011, at 20 years old, I was eager to do some travelling.
        <br>
        <br>
        Learning about design naturally lead me to discover parts of the world that seemed so interesting and so different to little ol' New Zealand at the bottom of the South pacific.<br>
        I have learnt so much from the places I`ve visited and lived in, as well as overcoming challenges and seeing things from different perspectives.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Over the last decade since graduating, I'm still obsessed with design, and have a long list of ideas and projects I'd like to work on. I love to collaborate with others and become very invested in whatever I work on.<br>
        <br> 
        During my time as a kitchen and interior designer I was able to extend my knowledge on different CAD software, learn about different materials and construction methods, build excellent relationships with clients, <br>
        and see my ideas come to life and take place in the heart of people's homes. I worked closely with and listened carefully to my clients to design something that would fit seamlessly with their lifestyle.<br>
        I loved the challenge and difference of each new brief and was always determined to find the best possible outcome. 
        <br>
        <br>
        As much as I loved my career in kitchen and interior design, I felt there was something else I wanted to be doing.<br>
        I still remember the first time I heard the term UX Design, it seemed like a new concept, but it wasn't.<br>
        The user experience and solving a problem to arrive at a solution was at the core of what I loved doing.<br>
        Unpacking a process, following a trail, and thinking of about the different scenarios has always been intriguing.<br>
        I became curious about digital products and UX/UI design, this lead me to completing a Diploma in Web Development and design.<br>
